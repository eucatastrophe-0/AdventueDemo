# AdventueDemo
Text based adventure game I coded and updated as I learned Java.  Simple, but fun!

The AdventureDemo is inspired by early text based adventure and role playing games.
I coded the original file in my first semester of Java, before I had learned about methods or any sort of object oriented programming techniques.
As I progressed in my education, I continued to improve and update the code, implementing what I learned.
It is unpolished and unfinished, but I do think it shows my growth as a coder over the years.
This is why I am including it in my portfolio.

See [AdventureDemo readme.docx] for a description of the files in this project.
